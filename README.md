**Artificial Neural Network Simulation Toolkit**

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for exploring and simulating Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using both MATLAB and Python. It includes:

- üß† **MATLAB App-Based Simulations**: Interactive tools built with MATLAB App Designer to visualize and experiment with neural network architectures, training processes, and performance metrics.
- üêç **Python Implementations**: Modular and well-documented Python scripts demonstrating core ANN concepts, including feedforward networks, backpropagation, activation functions, and optimization techniques.
- üìä **Cross-Platform Learning**: Designed to bridge theoretical understanding with practical application, this repository supports learners, educators, and researchers working across both MATLAB and Python environments.

Whether you're validating models, teaching neural network fundamentals, or building custom architectures, this toolkit offers a flexible and intuitive starting point.
